# Phone Book application

Create a phonebook which allows to keep peoples names and phones.
It has one page which allows to add, edit and remove entries
via XHR. It also allows to download the phonebook as a text file
(e.g. comma-separated) and also upload a new version.

When it uploads a file, it updates the phonebook, creating,
updating and deleting records as appropriate. In short it
has to sync (not just replace) the web-added data with
the uploaded file.
